# Low/no code websites
This time I try to build this design, using the site builder from nicepage. 

## I liked
- the applicationâ€™s ui is not hard to learn
- easy-to-use application
- the final result is good enough
- the final result can be exported for free as HTML,CSS, javascript
- free product
- semantic HTML 

## I didn't like
- using a svg image as a background image was quite buggy and difficult to work with
- `img` tags are created without `alt` attribute
- inline `style` tags
- use of unnecessary javascript
- use of jquerry
- making a responsive layout is a tedious process
